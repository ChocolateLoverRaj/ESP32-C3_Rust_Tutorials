# Chapter 01 - Blinky

We'll start with the quintessential embedded starter project:  blinking an LED on and off every half second.

In order to do this we'll need to:
1. Create a new project
2. Import the necessary crates
3. Initialize the hardware pin
4. Create a loop which turns the LED on/off periodically
