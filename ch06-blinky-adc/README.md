# Blinky ADC

In this example we'll use ADC values to blinky the LED at a certain PWM based on the ADC reading.

## TODO
1. get led pwm working
2. connect led pwm to adc
3. incorporate the led pwm into the current blinky state machine
  a. mutex for adc readings
  b. When it's time to blink look at the ADC reading and calculate a pwm
